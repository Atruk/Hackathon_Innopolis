# Hackathon_Innopolis
A task
- Prediction of small molecule activity for homologous targets
- Participants will be provided with a dataset of small molecule inhibitors with known experimental activity against COVID-19
- It is necessary to build a structure-property model for inhibitors
- Classification metrics will be used to build the leaderboard

Krypton.ipynb - Preprocessing and transformation of data for training models. A couple of models like logistic regression and gradient boosting.
Krypton_new_model_V2.ipynb - Several neural network models

Datasets:
- train.csv
- test.csv
- new_train_dataset.csv
- new_test_dataset.csv
- target.pdb
- submission.csv
